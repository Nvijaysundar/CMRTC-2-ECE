Scenario:

A cricket club organizes a tournament and keeps detailed records for calculating player rewards.

 Every player has:

   Jersey number (unique) → instance variable
   Runs scored in a match → instance variable
 The bonus rate per run is the same for all players (₹10) → static variable
 If a player’s runs are more than 50, they get an extra flat special bonus of ₹200 → constant (final).
 For each player, you must:

   Calculate total bonus using local variables in the calculation method.
   Accept runs and jersey number through a parameterized constructor.
 The system should also:

   Keep track of total players and total bonus payout (static variables).
   Display all player details with their calculated bonus.
   Finally print the total players and total payout at the end.



Sample Input


Player 1: Jersey=7, Runs=45  
Player 2: Jersey=18, Runs=60

Player 18  Runs: 60, Bonus: ₹800  
Player 10  Runs: 75, Bonus: ₹950
