In a small toll plaza system, each vehicle passing through must pay a toll fee based on its type.

 The toll fee per car is fixed at ₹50.
 The toll fee per truck is fixed at ₹100.
 The plaza also keeps track of the total vehicles passed and the total revenue collected for the day.

Write a Java program that:

1. Uses static variables to store the fixed toll fees for cars and trucks.
2. Uses instance variables to store the count of cars and trucks for that particular toll booth object.
3. Includes a method to calculate the total revenue for that booth using simple multiplication.
4. Demonstrates the program by creating multiple toll booth objects and printing:

    Cars passed
    Trucks passed
    Revenue for that booth
5. Finally, prints the total revenue and total vehicles for the entire plaza.
Sample Input
Booth 1: Cars=5, Trucks=2  
Booth 2: Cars=3, Trucks=4  

Sample Output

Booth 1  Cars: 5, Trucks: 2, Revenue: ₹450  
Booth 2  Cars: 3, Trucks: 4, Revenue: ₹550  
Total Vehicles: 14  
Total Revenue: ₹1000
