Passenger Intelligence Analyzer – Advanced Airline Boarding Data Simulation
You are part of the Aviation Intelligence & Verification Bureau (AIVB), responsible for auditing international flight passenger logs transmitted by airport terminals.
Each record arrives as an encoded boarding message, containing essential but unformatted details.
Your task is to decode, analyze, classify, and securely format each entry using restricted string tools — ensuring no arrays or collections are used.

 Problem Statement:

Develop a Java program that reads a block of raw boarding data and converts it into a structured and secure summary format.

 Input Specification:
Each message line contains mixed delimiters and coded data as follows:

<PassengerName>*<SeatNo>@<FlightCode>#<BoardingTime>$<Destination>

Example Input:

Myra_Watson*A10@SKY980#09:15AM$LONDON
Arjun_Kapoor*C22@AIV420#01:55PM$DUBAI
Sophia_Jones*B19@JET605#07:40PM$NEWYORK

 Processing Requirements:

1. Tokenization (Using StringTokenizer):
   Each line must be parsed using StringTokenizer with delimiters *, @, #, and $ to extract:

   Passenger Name
   Seat Number
   Flight Code
   Boarding Time
   Destination

2. String Operations:

   Replace _ with a space in the name.
   Extract the seat letter (A/B/C…) and number separately from SeatNo.
   Convert FlightCode to lowercase except the numeric digits.
   Extract hour from the time (as integer) and decide shift classification:

     Before 12PM → Morning Shift
     12PM to 5PM → Day Shift
     After 5PM → Night Shift
   If Destination contains “LONDON” or “NEWYORK” → mark as "International", else "Regional".

3. StringBuffer Operations:

   Reverse the passenger name using StringBuffer.
   Append the seat letter and constant code "AIVB2025".
   Example: Myra Watson → reversed → nostaW aryM → nostaW aryMAAIVB2025.

4. Derived Logic (Decision-Making):

   If seat number > 20 → “Rear Zone Passenger”, else “Front Zone Passenger”.
   If FlightCode starts with "aiv" → mark as "Government Carrier", else "Commercial Airline".
   If the Boarding Time ends with “AM” and destination is International → add "Priority Boarding" tag.

5. Final Formatting (StringJoiner):
   Combine all derived details as:

   EncodedName | Destination | FlightType | Zone | Shift | Status
   
 Example Input:


Myra_Watson*A10@SKY980#09:15AM$LONDON
Arjun_Kapoor*C22@AIV420#01:55PM$DUBAI
Sophia_Jones*B19@JET605#07:40PM$NEWYORK


 Expected Output:

Processed Boarding Intelligence Summary:
nostaW aryMAAIVB2025 | LONDON | Commercial Airline | Front Zone Passenger | Morning Shift | Priority Boarding
roopaK nujrAA AIVB2025 | DUBAI | Government Carrier | Rear Zone Passenger | Day Shift | Normal Boarding
senoJ aihpoSBAAIVB2025 | NEWYORK | Commercial Airline | Front Zone Passenger | Night Shift | Normal Boarding
